# 🧩 GRC & Compliance Frameworks

**Author:** Beryl Amondi Opara  
**Course:** IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate  
**Module:** Cybersecurity Compliance Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my understanding of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** concepts and major global cybersecurity frameworks. It highlights how organizations align their operations with security best practices, legal requirements, and risk management strategies to achieve and maintain compliance.

The frameworks studied include:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how GRC integrates into cybersecurity strategy  
- Map compliance requirements to security controls  
- Demonstrate knowledge of multiple frameworks and their relationships  
- Show practical awareness of how organizations assess, mitigate, and manage risks

## 🏗️ Framework Summaries

| Framework | Focus Area | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **NIST CSF** | Risk-based security management | Provides a structure for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. |
| **ISO 27001** | Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) | Focuses on establishing, implementing, and maintaining an ISMS through continuous improvement and internal audits. |
| **GDPR** | Data Privacy and Protection | EU regulation ensuring lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data; emphasizes data subject rights. |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare Data Security | Protects sensitive patient health information by requiring confidentiality, integrity, and availability safeguards. |

## 🔍 Compliance Mapping Example

| NIST Function | Example Control | Mapped Framework Equivalent |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Identify** | Asset Management (ID.AM-1) | ISO 27001: A.8.1.1 – Inventory of Assets |
| **Protect** | Access Control (PR.AC-1) | HIPAA Security Rule §164.312(a) |
| **Detect** | Anomalies and Events (DE.AE-1) | ISO 27001: A.12.4 – Logging and Monitoring |
| **Respond** | Response Planning (RS.RP-1) | ISO 27001: A.16.1 – Incident Management |
| **Recover** | Recovery Planning (RC.RP-1) | ISO 27001: A.17.1 – Business Continuity Planning |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- GRC ensures **cybersecurity efforts align with business and regulatory goals**  
- Compliance frameworks promote **consistency and accountability** across industries  
- Regular audits and documentation maintain continuous improvement  
- Cross-mapping frameworks (NIST ↔ ISO ↔ GDPR ↔ HIPAA) strengthens resilience and global readiness

## 🧾 Included Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **README.md** | Main project documentation |
| **Compliance_Frameworks_Report.pdf** | Extended report summarizing each framework’s structure, domains, and implementation examples (to be uploaded) |

## 💡 Next Steps

- Create a sample **Risk Register** or **Compliance Checklist** (optional)  
- Add visuals like a NIST lifecycle or ISO Plan-Do-Check-Act diagram  
- Expand into an organizational compliance audit report for your portfolio
